# Youtube Poll Manager

This Golang app provides an example of how to use the YouTube API to retrieve channel statistics and update video titles. It includes two example programs that demonstrate how to use either a service account or OAuth 2 authentication to access the YouTube API.

The first program retrieves the statistics for a specified YouTube channel, including the number of views, subscribers, and videos. The second program updates the title of a specified YouTube video. Both programs use the official Google API client library for Golang to interact with the YouTube API.
